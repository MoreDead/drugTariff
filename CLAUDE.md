# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is an empty project directory named "drugTariff" with minimal setup. The repository currently contains only Claude Code configuration files.

## Project Structure

The codebase is currently minimal:
- `.claude/settings.local.json` - Claude Code permissions configuration allowing npm commands

## Development Setup

This project appears to be in initial setup phase. No package.json, build scripts, or source code files are present yet.

## Permissions

Claude Code has been configured with permissions to run:
- `npm create:*` - Creating new npm projects
- `npm install` - Installing dependencies
- `npm install:*` - Installing specific packages

These permissions suggest this may be intended as a Node.js/npm-based project that is not yet initialized.
